Code and data for the manuscript "High dimensional piecewise exponential models: a precise average case analysis in the proportional asymptotics regime"

You can find four .py files:
1) required_functions.py --> ruotines used in run_rs.py and run_sim.py can be found here 
2) run_rs.py --> run the solution of the rs equations given the parameters that must be changed manually inside the script
3) run_sim.py --> run the simulations given the parameters that must be changed manually inside the script
4) new_plots.py --> plotting
